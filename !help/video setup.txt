well, here you just need to do some easy stuff:

first, copy the folder "webm" and paste it in the root of your pc "C:\", after thad,
press the windows key + the r key, and it will be open the run shit, just copy and paste "SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe" and press enter,
click in the button "Enviroment Variables", now scroll down in "System Variables " and find PATHEXT, check if says "EXE", if it dosn't,
press "PATHEXT", now "New", and where says "Variable name:" put "PATHEXT", and in "Variable value:" put ".EXE", now press "OK".Now, in
"User variables for ( here will say your username i)" press "Path", click on "Edit", it will be pop up a window, press where says "New",
and type "C:\webm\bin", now open Command Prompt or PowerShell, type "ffmpeg" and if it works, will be apear a lot of text, thad says than your done here.

after thad, where you import all the shit ( example: "import flixel.FlxState;" ),
put this shit: "import plugins.VideoState;".

now, go to "assets", inside the folder,
open "video", and put your video with the extension .webm there.

now, to switch state, just use this line of code:
FlxG.switchState(new VideoState('assets/videos/yoursourcevideo.webm', new YourClass(),0 , [true/false]));
where say "yoursourcevideo.webm" just change it with the name of yout file... .webm, and where says "YourClass", is where you will go when the video ends,

where i put a "0", you put your frameskip ( this shit can't be a float, just remember ), you want to se what hapend when you change it?, well, check your self,

just, don't set it in more than 2 ok?, if you dont do what i tell you, your video will look so faster and lagy, because it just skip the frames ._.,

where says "[true/false]" change it to true or false based on this shit, if it is true, the music playing will automatically be paused,
this is good for midway videos while playing or idk for pausing the game and showing the video cutscene.

if you don't understand, lick my nutz and read this ( https://github.com/GrowtopiaFli/openfl-haxeflixel-video-code ) or ask to kade-dev.

here a converter to make your videos to the format .webm ( https://video.online-convert.com/convert-to-webm ).
