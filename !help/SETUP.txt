Hello, this is the SETUP helper, here i gona explain step by step how to install everything to start modding
in this engine, and in any other engine.

First Step: install Haxe and Neko.

To instal Haxe n' Neko, just go to de haxe official page ( https://haxe.org/download/ ) and download the setup for your os.
After downloading the file, just open it, an press next, and next. You know, like in any other
setyo. Just remember to chech the checkBox than says "neko" and a bunch of numbers like "4.2.1"
or somthing, if you dont do this, will hive you errors while your developing your mod.

1.2 Step: install Git.
To install Git just go to the Official Git Download Page ( https://git-scm.com/downloads ) and download the setup for your os.
After downloading the file, just open it and install it as any program. After you install it, your ready to go.

Second step: install Vs Code and Vs BuildTools

To install Vs Code you go to the Official Microsoft Download Vs Code Page ( https://code.visualstudio.com/download ) and download
the setup for your os. After downloading the file, open it and pres next, and next, and next, like in any other setup. After
instaling Vs Code, you just install Vs BuildTools, just open this link ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828084042120953867/830191004686352444/vs_buildtools__1911057386.1611785237.exe )
and open the file than you just download, remember to download the c++ stuff, its the only reason why you need to do this, so, after you do everything than the program tell you ,
and reset your pc ( because, if you don't do it, any change will be afect your os ).

Last Step: instal the Haxe dependences:

After instaling Haxe and Neko, in the folder where you find this file, you will see another file called "Setup.bat".
Just, open it and it will install automaticly every dependence. After instaling everything, you can just, delete the file,
it really dont will change anything if you delete it or not. REMEMBER, when you are instaling flixel, it will tell you somthing
like "you want to use the subName flixel?" just say yes, and in the part, it will be ask you somthing of your code editor or some shit,
just type "3" and press enter, and now, you can start your mod experience in this new engine, and in this entire comunitty, have a good time
